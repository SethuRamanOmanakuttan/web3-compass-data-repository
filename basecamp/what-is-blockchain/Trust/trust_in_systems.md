### **Trust in Systems**

Trust is the cornerstone of every transaction you make, whether it's buying a cup of coffee or signing a million-dollar contract. We instinctively place trust in banks, notaries, or companies to ensure our transactions are accurate and secure. But what happens when trust goes wrong? Let's explore this with a familiar analogy.

Imagine buying a car from someone you've never met. To ensure you're not getting a lemon, you might bring along a trusted mechanic. You also rely on the DMV to verify the car's registration and the bank to transfer the payment securely. In this process, **you're putting your trust in multiple intermediaries** to guarantee a smooth, safe transaction.

But here's the catch: these intermediaries can fail. The mechanic might be biased, the DMV database could be hacked, or the bank's servers could go down. In traditional systems, trust is centralized, meaning a few key players hold the power to determine the outcome. This creates a **single point of failure**---if one player messes up, the whole transaction can go haywire.

Blockchain changes the game by **replacing centralized trust with decentralized verification**. Imagine if, instead of trusting one mechanic, you had an entire team of mechanics, all independently verifying the car's condition and the transaction. This is the essence of blockchain: it distributes trust across many participants, making it far less prone to error or manipulation. So, when you hear that blockchain is a "trustless" system, it doesn't mean there's no trust. It means trust isn't concentrated in the hands of a few---it's spread out, shared, and verified by many.
