# Creating the `SimpleBlock` Class

### **Introduction: Birth of the Block**

Congratulations! You’re about to take the first step in building your blockchain by creating its core unit—the **block**. This is where all the magic begins. Every blockchain is made up of these blocks, each one holding precious data and linking securely to the next like the links of a chain.

But before we dive into the code and start chaining things together, let’s slow down and understand what we’re building. After all, when you truly understand something, building it becomes both easier and more fun.

A **block** is essentially a container that holds:

1. **Data**: The valuable information you want to store (e.g., transactions, agreements, or records).
2. **Metadata (Block Header)**: Information about the block itself, such as:
    - When it was created.
    - Its position in the chain.
    - How it’s connected to the previous block.
    - A unique fingerprint called a **hash**, which ensures its integrity.

Think of a block as a tiny **digital vault**:

- It securely stores your data.
- It links itself to other blocks.
- And together, these blocks form an unbreakable chain.

But here’s the kicker: this chain is only unbreakable because of the unique structure of the blocks and the way they’re connected. Let’s start building it and see how the magic works.

### **Step 1: Importing the Hashing Library**

Every block needs a **hash** to ensure its integrity. A **hash** is a unique fingerprint that represents the contents of the block. Even a small change in the block’s data will result in a completely different hash, making tampering obvious.

To generate hashes, we’ll use Node.js’s built-in `crypto` module. It’s like our block’s fingerprint machine.

1. Open your `blockchain.js` file.
2. Add this line at the very top:
    
    ```jsx
    
    // Importing the crypto module for hashing
    const crypto = require("crypto");
    
    ```
    

No need to install anything—this module comes with Node.js by default. 

---

### **Step 2: Define the `SimpleBlock` Class**

Now, let’s define the **blueprint** for our blocks. A block has two main parts:

- **Header**: This contains metadata about the block, such as its position in the chain (`index`), the time it was created (`timestamp`), the link to the previous block (`previousHash`), and its unique fingerprint (`hash`).
- **Body**: This is where we store the actual data (e.g., transactions or records).

---

### **Basic Structure of the `SimpleBlock` Class**

```jsx

class SimpleBlock {
  constructor(blockIndex, timestamp, blockData, previousBlockHash = "") {
    // The metadata (header) of the block
    this.blockHeader = {
      index: blockIndex, // The position of the block in the blockchain
      timestamp, // When the block was created
      previousHash: previousBlockHash, // Links to the previous block in the chain
      hash: "", // This block's unique fingerprint (we'll calculate it soon)
      nonce: 0, // A random number used later for mining
    };

    // The data (body) stored in the block
    this.blockBody = {
      data: blockData, // The actual information stored in the block
    };
  }
}

```

### **Step 3: What is a Hash Function, and Why Does it Matter?**

A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that takes some input data (like our block’s metadata and data) and converts it into a fixed-length string of characters. This string is called a **hash**. Here’s why this is so important:

1. **Unique Fingerprint**: Every block has a unique hash, based on its contents. Even a tiny change in the block (e.g., editing a single character) will completely change the hash.
2. **Immutability**: If someone tries to tamper with a block, the hash will no longer match the block’s contents, making the tampering obvious.
3. **Secure Linking**: Each block contains the hash of the previous block. If any block is altered, the entire chain becomes invalid.

In our blockchain, we’ll use the **SHA-256 algorithm**, which is part of the `crypto` module. **SHA-256** is a cryptographic hash function widely used in blockchain systems, including Bitcoin. It produces a 64-character hexadecimal string, regardless of the size of the input.

---

### **How Does SHA-256 Work?**

Imagine you have a piece of data, like `"Hello, Blockchain!"`. When you pass it through the SHA-256 algorithm, it will output a hash like this:

```

c2b7c9fae53c15790db7c64f0a9a21dcd80ebc241c03b02b42b2e01eb97e5a16

```

Now, if you change the input to `"Hello, Blockchain!!"`, the hash will look completely different:

```

adf5e89b093f8f63bfb7d63478f6b2b9f10b9a6dd0c85c91e0e891546fb37f5f

```

This demonstrates how sensitive hash functions are to changes, making them perfect for ensuring data integrity.

---

### **Step 4: Add a Hashing Mechanism to Your Block**

Now that you understand what a hash is and why it’s important, let’s implement it in our block. We’ll create a method called `generateHash`, which calculates the hash based on the block’s metadata and data.

---

### **Code: Adding the `generateHash` Method**

Update your `SimpleBlock` class with this method:

```jsx

// Generates a unique hash for the block
generateHash() {
  // Extract key information from the block header
  const { index, timestamp, previousHash, nonce } = this.blockHeader;

  // Convert the block's data to a string
  const dataString = JSON.stringify(this.blockBody.data);

  // Generate a SHA-256 hash from the block's key details
  return crypto
    .createHash("sha256")
    .update(index + timestamp + previousHash + dataString + nonce)
    .digest("hex");
}

```

This function:

1. Takes all the important information about the block (`index`, `timestamp`, `previousHash`, `nonce`, and `data`) and combines them into one string
2. Passes this string through the SHA-256 algorithm to produce a hash.
3. Returns the hash.

---

### **Step 5: Automatically Generate the Hash**

To ensure every block has a hash when it’s created, we’ll call `generateHash` in the constructor. Update the constructor like this:

```jsx

this.blockHeader.hash = this.generateHash();

```

---

### **Complete Code for Lesson 3**

Here’s the full updated code:

```jsx

// Importing the crypto module for hashing
const crypto = require("crypto");

class SimpleBlock {
  constructor(blockIndex, timestamp, blockData, previousBlockHash = "") {
    this.blockHeader = {
      index: blockIndex, // Position of the block in the chain
      timestamp, // When the block was created
      previousHash: previousBlockHash, // Links to the previous block
      hash: "", // This block's unique fingerprint
      nonce: 0, // Random number for mining (to be used later)
    };

    this.blockBody = {
      data: blockData, // The information stored in the block
    };

    // Generate the hash for this block
    this.blockHeader.hash = this.generateHash();
  }

  generateHash() {
    const { index, timestamp, previousHash, nonce } = this.blockHeader;
    const dataString = JSON.stringify(this.blockBody.data);
    return crypto
      .createHash("sha256")
      .update(index + timestamp + previousHash + dataString + nonce)
      .digest("hex");
  }
}

// Creating the first block (Genesis Block)
const firstBlock = new SimpleBlock(0, Date.now(), "Genesis Block", "0");

// Displaying the first block with its hash
console.log("Here is your first block with a hash:", firstBlock);

```

---

### **Step 6: Run the Code**

Run the program using:

```bash
node blockchain.js
```

You’ll see the block printed with its hash included.

### **What’s Next?**
