## **Introduction: Building the Chain That Makes the Blockchain**

Youâ€™ve done an incredible job so farâ€”creating blocks, generating unique fingerprints (hashes) for them, and securing them with Proof of Work. But letâ€™s face it, a single block (or even two) isnâ€™t a **blockchain**, is it?

A blockchain is more than just a collection of blocksâ€”itâ€™s a **linked chain** of blocks, each one securely connected to the one before it. This linkage ensures tamper-proof integrity and makes the blockchain truly powerful.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll turn your blocks into a blockchain by introducing a new class, `SimpleBlockchain`, that will handle the chain of blocks. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll have a fully functional blockchain that grows securely as you add blocks.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll do:

1. Create the **genesis block**, the cornerstone of any blockchain.
2. Add methods to securely link new blocks into the chain.
3. Test the blockchain by adding blocks and visualizing its structure.

## **Step 1: Setting Up the `SimpleBlockchain` Class**

The `SimpleBlockchain` class is where the magic of the blockchain comes to life. Itâ€™s responsible for:

1. Managing the **entire chain** of blocks.
2. Linking each block securely to the previous one.
3. Ensuring that the chain maintains its integrity as it grows.

> Important: Before we start, ensure youâ€™ve added the `SimpleBlock` class to your file. The `SimpleBlockchain` class will build on top of it.

### **Instruction: Add the `SimpleBlockchain` Class**

Below your `SimpleBlock` class, add a new class named `SimpleBlockchain`. This is how weâ€™ll transition from managing single blocks to a full blockchain.

Letâ€™s start by adding the **genesis block**.

---

## **Step 2: Creating the Genesis Block**

Every blockchain begins with a **genesis block**, the first block in the chain. This block is special because:

1. It has no predecessor, so its `previousHash` is set to `"0"`.
2. It acts as the foundation of the blockchain. Without it, thereâ€™s no chain.

---

### **Code: Adding the Genesis Block**

Hereâ€™s the code for the `SimpleBlockchain` class that uses the `SimpleBlock` object to create the genesis block:

```jsx

class SimpleBlockchain {
  constructor() {
    // The blockchain starts with the genesis block
    this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
  }

  // Method to create the genesis block
  createGenesisBlock() {
    console.log("Creating the genesis block...");
    return new SimpleBlock(0, Date.now(), "Genesis Block", "0");
  }
}
```

---

## **How the Genesis Block is Created Using `SimpleBlock`**

### **Step 1: The `SimpleBlock` Class**

Before we dive into the `SimpleBlockchain` class, letâ€™s quickly recap the `SimpleBlock` class. Hereâ€™s what it does:

1. **Structure of a Block:**
    - The `SimpleBlock` class defines what a block looks like: its index, timestamp, data, the hash of the previous block, and its unique hash.
2. **Hashing and Mining:**
    - It uses a cryptographic hash function (`generateHash`) to create a unique fingerprint for the block.
    - The block can also be mined using the `mineBlock` method.

The `SimpleBlock` class is the blueprint for creating blocks.

### **Step 2: Using `SimpleBlock` in the Genesis Block**

In the `SimpleBlockchain` class, the `createGenesisBlock` method calls the `SimpleBlock` constructor to create a new block:

```jsx

return new SimpleBlock(0, Date.now(), "Genesis Block", "0");
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening step by step:

1. **Calling the Constructor:**
    - The `SimpleBlock` constructor is called with these arguments:
        - `0`: The index of the block (the genesis block is always the first block, so its index is `0`).
        - `Date.now()`: The timestamp of when the block is created.
        - `"Genesis Block"`: The data stored in the genesis block.
        - `"0"`: The `previousHash` is set to `"0"` because the genesis block has no predecessor.
2. **Inside the `SimpleBlock` Constructor:**
    - The `blockHeader` object is created, containing the blockâ€™s metadata:
        - `index`: The blockâ€™s position in the chain.
        - `timestamp`: The exact time the block was created.
        - `previousHash`: The hash of the previous block, which is `"0"` for the genesis block.
        - `hash`: Initially empty but will be generated soon.
        - `nonce`: Set to `0` initially.
    - The `blockBody` object is created to store the data (`"Genesis Block"` in this case).
    - The `generateHash` method is called to calculate a unique hash for the block based on its metadata and data.
3. **Returning the Block:**
    - Once the genesis block is created, itâ€™s returned to the `createGenesisBlock` method, which adds it to the blockchain.

---

### **Step 3: Storing the Genesis Block**

In the `SimpleBlockchain` classâ€™s `constructor`, the `createGenesisBlock` method is called, and the resulting block is stored in the `chain` array:

```jsx

this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
```

This ensures that every blockchain starts with the genesis block as its foundation.

With the genesis block in place, letâ€™s add the functionality to grow the blockchain by adding new blocks.

---

## **Step 3: Adding New Blocks**

For a blockchain to grow, it must:

1. **Link each new block** to the one before it using the `previousHash`.
2. **Mine the block** to meet the Proof of Work difficulty.
3. **Add the block to the chain** once itâ€™s valid.

---

### **Code: Adding Blocks**

Expand your `SimpleBlockchain` class with the following methods:

```jsx

class SimpleBlockchain {
  constructor() {
    this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
  }

  createGenesisBlock() {
    console.log("Creating the genesis block...");
    return new SimpleBlock(0, Date.now(), "Genesis Block", "0");
  }

  getLatestBlock() {
    // Retrieves the most recent block in the chain
    return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];
  }

  addNewBlock(newBlock) {
    // Link the new block to the latest block in the chain
    newBlock.blockHeader.previousHash = this.getLatestBlock().blockHeader.hash;

    // Mine the new block
    console.log(`Mining a new block with difficulty 2...`);
    newBlock.mineBlock(2);

    // Add the newly mined block to the chain
    this.chain.push(newBlock);
    console.log("Block successfully added to the blockchain!");
  }
}

```

---

### **Whatâ€™s Happening Here?**

1. **`getLatestBlock`:**
    - Fetches the last block in the chain.
    - Ensures that each new block links to the correct predecessor.
2. **`addNewBlock`:**
    - Links the `previousHash` of the new block to the `hash` of the latest block.
    - Mines the new block using the `mineBlock` method.
    - Adds the newly mined block to the chain.

> Why itâ€™s important: These methods enable your blockchain to grow dynamically while maintaining its integrity.

## **Step 4: Testing the Blockchain**

Now itâ€™s time to test your blockchain! Weâ€™ll:

1. Create an instance of `SimpleBlockchain`.
2. Add a few blocks to the chain.
3. Log the entire blockchain to visualize its structure.

---

### **Code: Testing the Blockchain**

Modify the code at the end of the file (the one after the class definitions) with the following snippet :

```jsx

// Instantiate a new blockchain
const myBlockchain = new SimpleBlockchain();

// Add two new blocks to the blockchain
const block1 = new SimpleBlock(1, Date.now(), "First block after genesis");
myBlockchain.addNewBlock(block1);

const block2 = new SimpleBlock(2, Date.now(), "Second block after genesis");
myBlockchain.addNewBlock(block2);

// Log the entire blockchain structure
console.log("\n--- Blockchain Structure ---");
console.log(JSON.stringify(myBlockchain, null, 2));

```

---

### **Instructions for Testing**

1. **Save Your File:**
    - Save your file as `blockchain.js`.
2. **Run the File:**
    - Open your terminal, navigate to the fileâ€™s location, and run:
        
        ```bash
        
        node blockchain.js
        ```
        
3. **Observe the Output:**
    - Check the terminal for the following:
        1. Genesis block creation.
        2. Mining of each new block, including its hash.
        3. Full blockchain structure in JSON format.

---

### **Expected Output**

Hereâ€™s an example of what you should see:

```
Creating the genesis block...
Mining a new block with difficulty 2...
Block mined with hash: 00c4d5...
Block successfully added to the blockchain!
Mining a new block with difficulty 2...
Block mined with hash: 0027ab...
Block successfully added to the blockchain!

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**

Youâ€™ve built a blockchain capable of linking blocks securely. But how do we ensure the chain remains valid as it grows? In the next lesson, weâ€™ll explore **chain validation** and what happens when someone tries to tamper with a block. Letâ€™s keep building in **Lesson 6**!
