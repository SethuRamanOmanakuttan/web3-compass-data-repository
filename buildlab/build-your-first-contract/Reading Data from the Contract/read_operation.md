#### Read Operation

---

Now that we can create data in our smart contract, the next step in our CRUD system is to **read** this data. The read operation will allow us to retrieve stored data and display it. In Solidity, reading data is relatively straightforward, as we can make our functions **public** and **view**.

1.  **Creating a Read Function**\
     Let's create a function called `getPerson` that takes in an ID and returns the details of the `Person` associated with that ID:

        `function getPerson(uint id) public view returns (string memory, uint, address) {
        Person memory person = peopleMap[id];
        return (person.name, person.age, person.wallet);

    }`

        - **`public view`**: This function is marked as `view` because it does not modify the contract's data, only reads from it.
        - **Parameters and Return Values**: The function takes in a `uint id` and returns `string memory`, `uint`, and `address` values, which represent the `name`, `age`, and `wallet` address of the `Person`.

2.  **Using the Public Visibility Modifier**\
    In Solidity, variables or functions marked with `public` visibility are accessible both inside and outside the contract. Since `peopleMap` is public, Solidity will automatically generate a `getter` function for us. By calling `peopleMap(id)`, we can directly access the `Person` struct associated with that ID.

**Example**: Accessing `peopleMap` directly

`// This line is auto-generated by Solidity for a public mapping
peopleMap[0]; // Accessing the first Person`

1.  **Testing the Read Operation in Remix**
    - Deploy your contract.
    - Use the `createPerson` function to add a few entries.
    - Call `getPerson` with the ID of a `Person` you've added to check if you retrieve the correct details.

**Practice Task**

- In `CRUDContract.sol`, implement the `getPerson` function to retrieve details by ID.
- Deploy the contract on Remix, add a few `Person` entries, and use the `getPerson` function to read the data.
